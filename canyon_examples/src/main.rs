        Canyon also has a powerful querybuilder.
        Every associated function or method provided through the macro implementations
        that returns a QueryBuilder type can be used as a raw builder to construct
        the query that Canyon will use to retrive data from the database.

        One really important thing to note it's that any struct annotated with the
        `[#canyon_entity]` annotation will generate and enumeration following the 
        convention: Type identifier + Fields holding variants to identify every
        field that the type has.

        So for a -> 
            pub struct League { /* fields */ }
        an enum with the fields as variants its generated ->
            pub enum LeagueFields { /* variants */ }

        So you must bring into scope `use::/* path to my type .rs file */::TypeFields`
        or simply `use::/* path to my type .rs file */::*` with a wildcard import.
        
        The querybuilder methods usually accept one of the variants of the enum to make a filter
        for the SQL clause, and a variant of the Canyon's `Comp` enum type, which indicates
        how the comparation element on the filter clauses will be
